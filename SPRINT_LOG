Sprint #2: Feb 2 - Feb 15, Web Wizards, JJ Gilbert, Kah Guan Ong, Shannon Katolsky, Zoha Khan 

Planned User Stories & Tasks: 
As President, I want to manage users (freeze the accounts of former members or create accounts for new members) so that I can preserve the system integrity of the site. As a User (President/Head/Member/Admin), I might forget or lose my password and want to be able to reset my password just in case, so that I can safely recover access to my account.
As President, I want to receive request from visitors to join our organization so that we can expand our horizons
As a Member, I want to view and update my personal profile so that my contact information and preferences are correct. Set up user database tables *Users, Roles, Permissions)
As an Admin, I want to assign user roles and grant permissions so that access is properly controlled. Build a login page with username/password form.
Implement role-based access control (President, Dept Head, Member, Admin)
Build account request submission form
Create presidential approval workflow
Develop member management CRUD operations
Build member profile pages 

Completed User Stories & Tasks:

As a Member, I want to view and update my personal profile so that my contact information and preferences are correct. Set up user database tables *Users, Roles, Permissions)

Bug Tracking: 

JJ:
- Issue: Files disappeared after branch switching; manage_roles.php, assign_role_process.php, and include/db_connect.php were not found after switching between branches in GitHub Desktop. 
  Resolution: Recreated missing files in the feature/user-roles branch and verified all paths were correct.
  
- Issue: Database permission error; "DELETE command denied to user 'mgs_user'" when attempting to change user roles.
  Resolution: Updated database grants to include DELETE permission and modified assign_role_process.php to use UPDATE instead of DELETE/INSERT for role changes.
  
- Issue: Admin link not appearing on homepage despite correct role assignment in database.
  Resolution: Added debug logging to verify session and role query execution, confirmed link displays correctly for users with Admin role (role_id = 4).
