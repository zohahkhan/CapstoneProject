Sprint #1: Jan 20 - Feb 1, Web Wizards, JJ Gilbert, Kah Guan Ong, Shannon Katolsky, Zoha Khan 

Planned User Stories & Tasks: 
As a User (President/Head/Member/Admin), I want my login experience to be secure and authenticated so that my account role is only available to authorized personnel.
As a User (President/Head/Member/Admin), I might forget or lose my password and want to be able to reset my password just in case, so that I can safely recover access to my account.
As a User (President/Head/Member/Admin), I want to terminate my account’s session by logging out so that I can protect my information from the outside, especially if I use an untrusted device.
As a User (President/Head/Member/Admin), after I log in, I want to see a personalized dashboard so that I can quickly navigate relevant functions for my role and to know at first glance what the platform offers.
Set up user database tables *Users, Roles, Permissions)
Implement password hashing and secure storage
Build a login page with username/password form
Create session management system
Implement logout functionality

Tests: Tests were done for pull requests. We ran into a few issues when setting up the database. When we changed the username to ‘root’ and the password to ‘’, the db_connect file was able to work; however, before that, XAMPP was giving an issue when attempting to connect. 

Bug Tracking: No bugs to record this sprint
