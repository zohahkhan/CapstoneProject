Sprint #2: Feb 2 - Feb 15, Web Wizards, JJ Gilbert, Kah Guan Ong, Shannon Katolsky, Zoha Khan 

Planned User Stories & Tasks: 
As President, I want to manage users (freeze the accounts of former members or create accounts for new members) so that I can preserve the system integrity of the site. As a User (President/Head/Member/Admin), I might forget or lose my password and want to be able to reset my password just in case, so that I can safely recover access to my account.
As President, I want to receive request from visitors to join our organization so that we can expand our horizons
As a Member, I want to view and update my personal profile so that my contact information and preferences are correct. Set up user database tables *Users, Roles, Permissions)
As an Admin, I want to assign user roles and grant permissions so that access is properly controlled. Build a login page with username/password form.
Implement role-based access control (President, Dept Head, Member, Admin)
Build account request submission form
Create presidential approval workflow
Develop member management CRUD operations
